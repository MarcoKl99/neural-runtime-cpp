# Neural Runtime C++ 🧠

A small Deep Learning runtime in modern C++, implemented from first principles - Tensor,
Matrixoperations, Backprop, Autograd and more! Step by step without ML dependencies in the core.

## Status 🔎

In active development.

First building block:

- Tensor-class (1D/2D, row-major, double precision)
- Initialization
- Element access
- Tests

Implemented operations:

- Elementwise addition (`operator+`, `operator+=`)
- Elementwise subtraction (`operator-`, `operator-=`)
- Hadamard product (`hadamard(...)`)
- Matrix multiplication (`matmul(...)`, rank 2 only)
- Transpose (`transpose()`, rank 2 only)
- Scalar multiplication (`operator*`, `operator*=`)

Second building block:

- `Linear` layer (affine transformation `y = W*x + b`)
- Randomly initialized weights (normal distribution, mu=0, sigma=0.1)
- `set_weights(...)` for deterministic testing / reference comparison
- Tests

Third building block:

- Activation functions (free functions, `nrt/activations.hpp`): `relu`, `relu_derivative`,
  `sigmoid`, `sigmoid_derivative`
- Tests

Fourth building block:

- `Tensor::sum()`
- MSE loss (`nrt/loss.hpp`, free function `mse(y_hat, y) -> double`)
- Tests

More to come! 🚀
